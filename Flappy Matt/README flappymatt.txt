Thanks for looking at my first project!
Thought I would include some instructions in case you've never used Unity before.

Might come back to fine tune some things (like adding a local high score tracker), but I don't want to take too much time away from Tech Elevator so I'm happy with where this is at on my .NET journey. :)

*** RECOMMENDED ***
Create a folder to hold the contents of the download

1. Download the contents of the "Flappy Matt Data" folder.
2. Place all those contents in your created folder (or wherever you wish them to reside).
	NOTE: might have to unzip files. Not sure how git downloads vs Google Drive.
3. Click the Flappy Matt.exe
4. Have fun!
