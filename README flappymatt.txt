Thanks for looking at my first project!
Thought I would include some instructions in case you've never used Unity before.

This only runs on windows.

Might come back to fine tune some things (like adding a local high score tracker), but I don't want to take too much time away from Tech Elevator so I'm happy with where this is at on my .NET journey. :)

*** RECOMMENDED ***
Create a folder to hold the contents of the download

1. Download the contents of the "Flappy Matt Data" folder AS A ZIPFILE.
2. Extract all those contents in your created folder (or wherever you wish them to reside).
3. Click the Flappy Matt.exe
4. Have fun!
