Thanks for looking at my first project!
Thought I would include some instructions in case you've never used Unity before.

This only runs on Windows. (I think)

Might come back to fine tune some things (like adding a local high score tracker and, y'know.....arms), 
but I don't want to take too much time away from Tech Elevator. 
So I'm happy with where this is at on my .NET journey. :)
